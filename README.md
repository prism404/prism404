Hi there ! Welcome to my Github ! ![](https://github.com/prism404/meteor-rain.gif)
Today, i'm looking for a work-study contract where i can be 3 weeks at the company and 1 week at my campus.
I'm currently based in Paris and my goal is to join a dynamic and motivated company where i'll put my knowledge in practice. 
Hardworking, organized and endowed with an analytical mind, I will take care to assimilate the different needs of your group and will easily be able to integrate myself.
